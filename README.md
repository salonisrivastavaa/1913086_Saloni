# Apriori Algorithm (1913086)

This is a Data Mining and Machine Learning algorithm called Apriori Algorithm. It takes input and generates association rules.


## Running the tests
The program takes data source, Minimum Support in percentage and Minimum Confidence in percentage as input.

- Data Source: This is to select where the input is coming from. For this test, the data is coming from csv file named Apriori Dummy.

- Minimum Support: A minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database.

- Minimum Confidence: A minimum confidence is applied to these frequent itemsets in order to form rules.

- Result: The result will show the association rules in the given dataset with the given minimum support and minimum confidence if there are any.

Here, minimum support is taken as 0.5 (50%)
